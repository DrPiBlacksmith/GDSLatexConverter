This a fork of python library from @Aypac which allows conversion of gds (II) files / gdspy libraries to (lua-)latex and subsequently svg, pdf, png, jpeg from third party softwares. A major change has been included to assure that the library handle real full chip GDS files with a circuit layout bigger than 100 x 100 um^2. Original version often crashes lualatex/pdflatex during pdf generation. The solution proposed in this fork is changing the scaling and fixing the figure size to the documentclass page width (maximum size)

Install using pip:

`pip install git+https://github.com/DrPiBlacksmith/GDSLatexConverter.git`
